## 5. Observations & Analysis

### Part_a: Binary Classification Using Handcrafted Features and ML Classifiers

##### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- The SVM model performed **fairly well**, achieving an accuracy of **88.05%**.
- It maintained a good balance between **precision and recall**, meaning it didn’t favor one class over the other.
- The **f1-score of 0.88** suggests that the model makes reliable predictions but still has some room for improvement.
- A few misclassifications could be due to **lighting variations, occlusions, or feature extraction limitations**.
- Overall, SVM does a solid job, but it might not be the best option for complex patterns.

##### Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- The MLP model performed **better than SVM**, with an accuracy of **92.56%**.
- Its **f1-score of 0.93** shows that it captures patterns more effectively.
- Compared to SVM, MLP had **fewer false negatives**, meaning it was better at correctly identifying both masked and unmasked faces.
- The improvement is likely because MLP, being a neural network, can learn more **complex relationships** in the data.
- With some fine-tuning (like adjusting hidden layers or activation functions), it could perform even better.

##### Key Takeaways:
- **Handcrafted features (HOG + LBP) were effective**
- For further improvements, switching to a **CNN-based feature extraction approach** might be the next step.


### Part_b: Using CNN

#####  CNN   
✅ With CNN, we saw a **huge improvement**, achieving **96.3% accuracy**, making it clear that deep learning is far more effective for this task.

#####  Accuracy Trends
- The model **quickly hit 100% training accuracy**, but validation accuracy leveled off at **~96%**.  
- This suggests **overfitting**—the model memorized the training data well but didn’t generalize perfectly to new images.  
- Still, **96% validation accuracy** is a solid performance!

#####  Test Performance  
- **Final test accuracy:** **96.3%**—way better than traditional methods.  
- **Breakdown of results:**  
  - "With Mask" → **97% Precision, 96% Recall**  
  - "Without Mask" → **96% Precision, 96% Recall**  
- This means the model is **equally good** at classifying both categories, with no major bias.

#### Hyperparameters and Experiments

The following hyperparameters and experimental settings were used in the code:

1. **Image Resizing**: The images are resized to 64x64 pixels to match the input size required by the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
   ```python
   img = cv2.resize(img, (64, 64))  # Resize to match CNN input

2. **Normalization**: The pixel values of the images are normalized to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255.0
   ```python
   X = np.array(X, dtype=np.float32) / 255.0  # Normalize pixel values

4. **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets with a test size of 20% and a random state of 42 for reproducibility.
   ```python
   train_X, test_X, train_Y, test_Y = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

### Part_c: Segmentation using traditionals
##### **1. Segmentation Performance**
| Method                | IoU Score | Dice Score |
|-----------------------|----------|------------|
| **Region Growing**    | 0.3997   | 0.5365     |
| **Otsu’s Thresholding** | 0.3156   | 0.4430     |

##### **Region Growing Method**
- Achieved **higher accuracy**, with an IoU of **0.3997** and a Dice score of **0.5365**.
- Adaptive to local intensity variations but **sensitive to tolerance selection**.
- Works well on images with smooth transitions but may leak into adjacent regions.


##### **Otsu’s Thresholding**
- Lower IoU of **0.3156** and Dice score of **0.4430**.
- Global thresholding leads to **over-segmentation or under-segmentation** in non-uniform lighting conditions.
- Computationally efficient but **not adaptive** to local intensity variations.

#### **2. Key Takeaways**
- **Region Growing is more accurate** but requires fine-tuning of tolerance.
- **Otsu’s method is faster**, but struggles in varying lighting conditions.
- **Potential Improvements:**
  - Experimenting with **K-Means clustering** for more adaptive segmentation.
  - **Hybrid approaches**, such as Otsu + Morphological processing, may enhance results.
  - Using **deep learning-based segmentation** for further accuracy improvement.

#### **3. Conclusion**
Region Growing currently performs better for this dataset, but further tuning and hybrid approaches could yield even better results.


### Part_d: Using UNet method to get better output.

This project explores four implementations of U-Net models for segmenting face crops from images in the MSFD dataset. Each code builds on the previous, introducing architectural changes, training strategies, and loss functions. Below is an analysis of their performance, strengths, and weaknesses.

#### Dataset
- **Source**: Images (`.\MSFD\MSFD\1\face_crop`) and masks (`.\MSFD\MSFD\1\face_crop_segmentation`).
- **Preprocessing**: Resized to 128x128, normalized to [0, 1], split into 80% training and 20% validation.

#### Model Implementations

#### Code 1: Baseline U-Net
- **Architecture**: 3 encoder levels (64, 128, 256), 512-filter bridge, 3 decoder levels, mixed precision training.
- **Training**: 20 epochs, batch size 8, binary cross-entropy loss, `EarlyStopping`, `ModelCheckpoint`.
- **Metrics**:
  - Accuracy: 0.6067
  - Dice Score: 0.0126
  - IoU Score: 0.006
- **Observations**: Poor segmentation (near-zero Dice/IoU), moderate accuracy likely due to background dominance. Fast inference (4s) thanks to mixed precision.
- **Issues**: Insufficient training or data mismatch likely caused failure to segment faces.

#### Code 2: Enhanced U-Net with BatchNormalization and LeakyReLU
- **Architecture**: 3 encoder levels (64, 128, 256), 512-filter bridge, `BatchNormalization`, `LeakyReLU`.
- **Training**: 30 epochs, batch size 8, binary cross-entropy, `EarlyStopping`, `ReduceLROnPlateau`, `ModelCheckpoint`.
- **Metrics**:
  - Accuracy: 0.5818
  - Dice Score: 0.8799
  - IoU Score: 0.7856
- **Observations**: Excellent segmentation (high Dice/IoU), slightly lower accuracy reflects better foreground focus. Slower inference (9s) without mixed precision.
- **Strengths**: `BatchNormalization` and adaptive learning rate improved performance significantly.

#### Code 3: Deeper U-Net with Conv2DTranspose
- **Architecture**: 4 encoder levels (64, 128, 256, 512), 1024-filter bridge, `Conv2DTranspose` with cropping.
- **Training**: 30 epochs, batch size 8, binary cross-entropy, no callbacks.
- **Metrics**:
  - Accuracy: 0.5852
  - Dice Score: 0.8686
  - IoU Score: 0.7677
- **Observations**: Strong segmentation (close to Code 2), deeper model adds complexity but lacks training optimization. Slowest inference (12s).
- **Issues**: No `EarlyStopping` risks overfitting; no mixed precision increases compute cost.

#### Code 4: U-Net with Dice Loss
- **Architecture**: 3 encoder levels (64, 128, 256), 512-filter bridge, `Conv2DTranspose`, mixed precision.
- **Training**: 20 epochs, batch size 16, custom `dice_loss`, `EarlyStopping`, `ReduceLROnPlateau`, `ModelCheckpoint`.
- **Metrics**:
  - Accuracy: 0.3612
  - Dice Score: 0.4360
  - IoU Score: 0.2787
- **Observations**: Moderate segmentation, lowest accuracy due to Dice loss focus. Fast inference (4s) with mixed precision.
- **Issues**: Dice loss didn’t yield high Dice/IoU, possibly due to short training or large batch size.

#### Comparative Analysis
| Code | Accuracy | Dice Score | IoU Score | Inference Time | Key Features |
|------|----------|------------|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| 1    | 0.6067   | 0.0126     | 0.006     | 4s             | Baseline, mixed precision |
| 2    | 0.5818   | 0.8799     | 0.7856    | 9s             | BatchNorm, LeakyReLU, scheduler |
| 3    | 0.5852   | 0.8686     | 0.7677    | 12s            | Deeper, Conv2DTranspose |
| 4    | 0.3612   | 0.4360     | 0.2787    | 4s             | Dice loss, mixed precision |

- **Best Segmentation**: Code 2 (Dice 0.8799, IoU 0.7856) excels, balancing architecture and training enhancements.
- **Fastest**: Codes 1 and 4 (4s) leverage mixed precision.
- **Worst Performer**: Code 1 fails at segmentation; Code 4 underperforms despite Dice loss.

#### Recommendations
1. **Data Validation**: Inspect image-mask pairs (especially for Code 1’s failure).
2. **Training Duration**: Extend epochs for Codes 1 and 4 (e.g., to 30).
3. **Loss Function**: Combine Dice and cross-entropy (e.g., for Code 4) to balance accuracy and segmentation.
4. **Efficiency**: Add mixed precision to Codes 2 and 3 for faster inference.
5. **Visualization**: Plot predicted vs. true masks to diagnose issues.

#### Conclusion
Codes 2 and 3 achieve robust face segmentation, with Code 2 slightly ahead due to training optimizations. Code 1 serves as a cautionary baseline, while Code 4’s Dice loss experiment suggests further tuning is needed. Future work could blend Code 2’s enhancements with Code 4’s loss approach for optimal results.
